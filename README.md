# Dev.Pro Personal Development Plan Project for Software Engineer Intermediate II 

This repository is a study project to prepare for my second seniority assessment at Dev.Pro, some technical gaps in React.js were identified and this application serves as a major review of the technology.

The project consists of a very simple application for managing teams and working hours, the next application serves as a fullstack system performing all CRUD functionalities and Laravel accompanies it as a microservice for calculating working hours.
